# Title: 
Sales Analysis and Forecasting Dashboard
# Tools Used:
Power BI: For data visualization, dashboard creation, report generation, forecasting, and DAX calculations.
Power Query Editor: To perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for data cleaning and preparation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated columns, measures, and advanced analytics.
# Problem Statement:
The primary objective was to develop a dynamic and insightful sales analysis dashboard that not only presents key sales metrics but also forecasts future sales performance. The dashboard needed to cater to decision-makers by providing actionable insights on revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance, ultimately guiding strategic business decisions.
# Project Overview:
In this project, I utilized Power Query Editor to handle the ETL process, ensuring that the data was clean, structured, and ready for analysis. Following this, I employed data modeling techniques in Power BI to establish relationships between different data tables, enabling accurate and insightful analysis. The project also involved creating calculated columns and measures using DAX, enhancing the depth of analysis.
# Impact and Outcomes:
The Sales Analysis and Forecasting Dashboard provides decision-makers with a comprehensive and interactive tool to monitor sales performance, predict future trends, and make informed strategic decisions. By forecasting sales for the next 10 months, the dashboard empowers businesses to anticipate market demands, optimize inventory management, and align their strategies with future revenue goals.
